# Donate

Code for Recovery is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

None of our people ask for or receive remuneration for their service. Neither do we expect our team to foot the bill for our user base.

## Contributions are used for expenses only

Money is a factor in our solutions. With your donation, we can foot the bill for things like hosting fees for website and Content Delivery Network (CDN), geocoding, and other supporting services that improve the effectiveness and availability of our solutions. These things lower the barrier of entry for new groups and make it easier for recovery communities to organize and recover.

If you are interested in donating or would like to know exactly what your money would be used for, please email [info@code4recovery.org](mailto:info@code4recovery.org).
